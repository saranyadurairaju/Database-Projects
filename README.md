# Database-Projects

**Tools and Technologies**: SQL, Postgres, ETL, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Python, Pandas and Flask

## Surfs-UP Business Analysis with SQLAlchemy and Flask

In this project, new tools such as SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask are used to build with the knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods. Python code is written using Jupyter notebook to create graphs. Worked on Sqlite database to extract the weather summary as its a important factor for surfing. As of now below details are focused: 

* The Summary Statistics for June
* The Summary Statistics for December
* Key differences between June and December weather
* Additional queries to perform to gather more weather data

## Amazing Prime Data cleaning with ETL

Learnt the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to create data pipelines. A data pipeline moves data from a source to a destination, and the ETL process creates data pipelines that also transform the data along the way. Analysis is impossible without access to good data, so creating data pipelines is often the first step before any analysis can be performed. Therefore, understanding ETL is an essential skill for data analysis. Below process are learnt out of this module:

* Created an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database
* Extracted data from disparate sources using Python
* Cleaned and transformed data using Pandas
* Used regular expressions to parse data and to transform text into numbers
* Loaded data with PostgreSQL

## Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis with Postgres SQL

Data modeling, engineering, and analysis are covered in this section. By Applying the knowledge of DataFrames and tabular data, created entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), imported data into a database, troubleshoot common errors, and created queries that use data to answer questions. Databases are used everywhere—small and large businesses, and even individuals working on personal projects—and SQL is one of the most widely used query languages. Its ability to organize and query data, especially on a large scale, makes SQL knowledge a highly sought after skill in the workforce.

* Designed an ERD that will apply to the data.
* Created and use a SQL database.
* Imported and export large CSV datasets into pgAdmin.
* Practiced using different joins to create new tables in pgAdmin.
* Wrote basic- to intermediate-level SQL statements.
